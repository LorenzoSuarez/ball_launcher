# Ball Launcher
Ball Launcher with Arduino

I made this ball launcher for my dog.

As the ball enters, it detects a change in the distance inside, turns on the motors, makes a sound, and contracts the solenoid to release the ball for launch. It contains a potentiometer to regulate the power of the motors.

Contains:
* Arduino Nano
* Electromagnet 12vdc To 24vdc Solenoid
* HC-SR04 Ultrasound Sensor
* Driver For Motors With Double Mosfet 5-36v 15a Arduino
* Double H-Bridge Driver L298N
* Step Up 3.5-35v 6a LCT1871
* Potentiometer 3pin WH148 10k
* Relay Module Relay 1 Channel 5v
* Passive Buzzer Module
* 2 motors 12 VDC
